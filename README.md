**üßÆ Engineering Calculator (Tkinter Version)**

A modern Engineering Calculator built with Python and Tkinter ‚Äî designed for scientific and engineering computations with a clean, responsive interface.
This version includes read-only display, DEG/RAD mode switching, and automatic parentheses correction for trigonometric functions.

**‚ú® Features**

Modern GUI using tkinter.ttk with custom styles

Read-only display (Label instead of Entry) to prevent manual edits

Degree (DEG) and Radian (RAD) mode toggle

Automatic parenthesis fix for trigonometric functions in DEG mode

Supports advanced math operations, including:

Trigonometric and inverse functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, etc.)

Logarithmic functions (ln, log10)

Square root, power, factorial, and percentage

Constants œÄ and e

Previous answer recall with ANS key

Keyboard shortcuts

Enter ‚Üí Evaluate

Backspace ‚Üí Delete last character

**üß† Safe Evaluation**

The calculator uses a restricted math environment to safely evaluate expressions.
Only functions from Python‚Äôs math module and pow() are allowed ‚Äî ensuring security while maintaining full scientific functionality.
